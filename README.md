# Cryptocurrency project

Single file project written in Python that I did during a Blockchain course.
This was helpfull for me to adquire the main concepts of how a criptocurrency works.

## Disclaimer

**I'm not the author of this app**. I just followed the tutorial to learn the concepts and practice python.
This project is part of the awesome course [_Curso Completo de Blockchain de cero a experto_](https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-completo-de-blockchain-de-la-a-a-la-z/) by **Joan Amengual** and **Juan Gabriel Gomila Salas**. It's in spanish :)

## Test this app

Prerequisites: You will need python installed in your pc.

1. Clone this repo.
2. Execute blockchain.py using the run button in VisualStudio Code, or in the command line:
`$ python blockchain.py `

This code runs entirely in the command line where you can see how _Andr√©s_, _John_ and _Julia_ are mining blocks with some transactions between different "users". Also you can see the time of the mining proccess, the rewards earned by miners, and the validation of the chain.
