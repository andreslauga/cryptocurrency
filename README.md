# Cryptocurrency

Single-file project written in Python that I did during a Blockchain course.
This was helpful for me to acquire the main concepts of how a cryptocurrency works.

## Disclaimer

**I'm not the author of this app**. I just followed the tutorial to learn the concepts and practice Python.
This project is part of the awesome course [_Curso Completo de Blockchain de cero a experto_](https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-completo-de-blockchain-de-la-a-a-la-z/) by **Joan Amengual** and **Juan Gabriel Gomila Salas**. It's in Spanish :)

## Test this app

Prerequisites: You will need Python installed on your pc.

1. Clone this repo.
2. Execute blockchain.py using the run button in Visual Studio Code, or in the command line typing:
`$ python blockchain.py `

This code runs entirely in the command line, where you can see how _Andr√©s_, _John_, and _Julia_ are mining blocks with some transactions between different "users". Also, you can see the time of the mining process, the rewards earned by miners, and the validation of the chain.
